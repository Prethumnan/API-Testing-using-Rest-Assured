# üß™ E-commerce API Automation Testing (Rest Assured)

This project contains a robust, organized, and fully automated API test suite for the E-commerce service provided by `automationexercise.com/api_list`. The suite is developed using **Java, Rest Assured, and TestNG**.

It demonstrates proficiency in building a scalable API automation framework, covering request construction, comprehensive validation, and reporting.

## üìÇ Framework Architecture

The project follows a standard, modular structure for scalability:

* **`src/main/java/API`**: Contains classes representing the API resources (`Auth`, `Brands`, `Products`, `User`) for centralized endpoint definitions.
* **`src/test/java`**: Contains the actual test classes (`Auth`, `Brands`, `Products`, `User`) where test methods are defined using **TestNG** annotations.
* **`utilities`**: Houses supporting classes like **`Base`** (for setup/teardown) and **`Listener`** (for integrating ExtentReports).
* **`testng.xml`**: The primary configuration file defining the entire test suite and enabling parallel execution.

### Key Features:
* Utilizes **TestNG Listeners** to automatically integrate **ExtentReports** for comprehensive reporting.
* Employs a **Page Object Model (POM)-like structure** for APIs, separating API resources from test execution logic.

## üìä Viewing the Report
After test execution, the detailed report is generated in the target directory:

1. Navigate to the target folder  
2. Open **ExtentReport.html** in any web browser
